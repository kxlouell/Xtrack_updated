        X-Track was developed by Computer Engineering Students of Technological Institute of the Philippines Quezon City Campus.
        The main purpose of X-track is to provide an enhanced offline map with the ability to locate other mobile devices
        in off-grid places by utilizing Mapping GPS technology and Wi-Fi Direct.

    <string name="about2">
        X-track is primarily designed for people who simply enjoy traveling in isolated places, such as hikers and trekkers,
        in order to ensure their safety in the event of an emergency. X-track was created by implementing the MapBox API Offline Map and
        adding some features such as location tracking which does not necessitate cellular network data or the internet,
        as well as notifying connected devices when they became disconnected.
